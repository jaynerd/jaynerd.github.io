### Limitations of explicit programming

Actual coding, like handling exceptions.
Too many rules.
Developers should specify what the program needs to do based on specific conditions.

### Machine Learning

Machine itself finds out the model, rules to classify, learning from data.

### Supervised Learning

Learning with labeled examples (training set).
Some pictures will contain a cat.
Some pictures will contain a dog.
Developers provide a cat, and dog's labeled dataset.

### Unsupervised Learning

Gathering/grouping similar information like Google news.
Word clustering.

### Problems can be solved by ML

Labeling images.
Filtering emails.
Predicting future scores from previous habbits.

### Requirements

Training dataset.
