### Machine Learning

Machine itself finds out the model, rules to classify, learns from data.

### Limitations of explicit programming

Too many rules.
Actual coding, like manually handling possible exceptions.
Developers should specify what the program needs to do based on specific conditions.

### Supervised Learning

Learning with labeled examples (training set).
Some pictures will contain a cat.
Some pictures will contain a dog.
Developers provide a cat, and dog's labeled dataset.

### Unsupervised Learning

Learning from un-labeled dataset
Gathering/grouping similar information like Google news.
Word clustering.

### Problems can be solved by ML

Labeling images.
Filtering emails.
Predicting future scores from previous habbits.

### Training dataset

A must have. Features telling specs of data. If x1 contains 1,2,3, and user inputs 3,2,1, the machine will return x1 which has similar features.
Previous Go matchs for AlphaGo.
