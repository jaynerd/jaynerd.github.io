### Machine learning

Basically, machine learns how to behave from training dataset and labels. Machine itself finds out the most suitable model, and uses it to process/classify input data.

### Limitations of explicit programming

Requires too many rules. It is an actual coding. Like manually handling all kinds of possible exceptions. Developers should specify what the program needs to in specific cases.

### Supervised Learning

Learning with labeled examples/training set. The machine should come up with a model that can sort out input data accroding to given labels. Like categorizing pictures with dog's features to a label called "dog".

### Unsupervised Learning

Learning from un-labeled dataset. Gathering/grouping similar information like Google news. Alike word clustering.

### Problems can be solved by ML

Labeling images (face recognition), filtering emails (spam emails). Predicting future scores from previous habbits/records (stock market prediction).

### Training dataset

A must have. Includes features telling specifications of raw data. If "x1" contains 1,2,3, and a user inputs 3,2,1, the machine will return "x1" which has similar features to the input. ex. previous Go matches for AlphaGo.
